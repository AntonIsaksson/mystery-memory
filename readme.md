# Mistery Memory Game #
### User Centric Milestone Project ###

### Project Info ### 
My goal is to make a Memory Game. The plan is to make it in 3 stages(/pages) with a different difficulty level on each (Easy, Medium and Hard). You play the game by clicking on a card, the card will flip to show a picture of a mysterious creature. This creature got a matching pair, so the users goal is to find its match. If a match is made, the 2 clicked cards will stay open. If the 2 clicked cards doesn't match, the cards will flip back over. If you manage to match all available cards, within a certain time-period and click-count, the user will move on to the next stage. If not, it's Game Over/Restart.
